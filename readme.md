You will find various files (hopefully) to import sample data into your Jira instance.

# Things to remember when importing
* Jira configurations are in place like Issue type, status, priority etc
* Date format should be correct. Check this link to learn about SimpleDateFormat: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html

Enjoy.
